# Hing-Lehsun-Daal-Tadka

Warning: Your place will smell like heaven/hell for a while.

## Ingredients
* Split pigeon pea (Toor daal) (1/2 cup uncooked, Other kinds of lentil can be used as well)
* Asafoetida (Hing) (1 pinch)
* 3 cloves of garlic (Lehsun)
* Green chilies (optional, can be replaced by other hot peppers)
* Turmeric (1/2 teaspoon)
* Cumin seeds (2 teaspoon)
* Vegetable oil (I prefer Soyabean or Sunflower oil)
* Non-vegan options for oil: Ghee (Clarified butter) (1 teaspoo)
* Salt

## Preparation

### Daal
* Wash daal twice and rinse any floating stuff.
* Soak daal in warm water for about 30 min (optional)

### Garlic
* Wash and chop finely.

## Cooking

### Pressure cooker option
* Put the daal in the cooker.
* Fill water about 2 inch above the bed of the daal.
* Add salt to taste.
* (Optional) You can add turmeric to the daal at this time. However, I like to do it later to avoid making the stove dirty in case the cooker leaks.
* Close the cooker and put on highest heat.
* After first whistle (pressure saturation), reduce heat to half.
* On getting second whistle, switch off the stove.
* Wait until the pressure comes down enought that the lid is not tight anymore.

### Sauce pan option
* Put daal in a deep sauce pan.
* Add water upto half height of pan.
* Add salt to taste.
* (Optional) You can add turmeric to the daal at this time. However, I like to do it later to avoid making the stove dirty in case the pan leaks.
* If you have a transparent lid,put on high heat with lid on. Otherwise, heat with open lid.
* When water starts boiling, take off the lid and reduce the heat to medium.
* Do not let the water spill out. Reduce heat appropriately.
* Keep adding more water to replinish evaporated water. 
* Cook for about 30 min untill the lentil is soft and starts dissolving in the water.
* Towards the end, control amount of water according to how thick you want the lentil.

### Putting in the tadka
* Take a small pan. Ideally, you want a very small frying spatula.
* Add oil to it and put on high flame.
* Add garlic, green chillies and Hing (Asafoetida) and wait for about 10s.
* Add cumin seeds and turmeric.
* (Optional, slightly dangerous) In case of ghee or low smoking point oil, you can use a lighter to light the contents of the frying pan on fire. Or if the flame is tall enough, you can just tilt the frying pan slightly to catch fire. This gives a burnt taste to garlic.
* Let the contents fry for about 15-20 seconds.  The cumin seeds will stop effervescing.
* Put the entire pan (if it fits) into the daal container (cooker or sauce pan), quickly closing the lid with another hand.
  - (If it doesn't fit) dropp the oil with contents into the daal but keep your distance.
  - Alernatiely, you can put a laddle full of daal into the frying pan and then put the mix back into the daal.
* Adjust turmeric and salt.

## Eating
Enjoyed best with

* Sabji (any kind)
* Added fun with lemon juice and fresh cilantro leaves.
