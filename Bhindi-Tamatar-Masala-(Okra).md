# Bhindi-Tamatar Masala (Okra)

## Ingredients
* Bhindi (Okra) (Everything listed for 250 gm)
* 2 Vine tomatoes or 3 Roma tomatoes.
* 1 Red onion
* 2-3 cloves of garlic and some ginger or 2 teaspoons of ginger-garlic paste
* Green chilies (optional, can be replaced by other hot peppers)
* Coriander (4 teaspoons)
* Turmeric (1/2 teaspoon)
* Red Chilli powder (According to taste)
* Cumin seeds (1 teaspoon)
* Garam masala (1 teaspoon)
* Vegetable oil (I prefer Soyabean or Sunflower oil)

## Preparation

### Bhindi
* Wash Bhindi in warm running water. Do not soak it underwater.
* Using a clean cloth, wipe each Bhindi gently to absorb excess water on the surface. Use different cloths to ensure that only dry cloth is used for this purpose.
* Chop the bhindi transversely in slices of about 3 mm thickness.
* Your knife will accumulate lace (a sticky substance) and some seeds. Wipe it off and throw it away.

### Tomatoes and Onion
* Chop tomatoes finely. Do not let the juice of tomatoes flow away.
* Chop onion finely.
* Chop according to taste some green chilies.
* Chop or make a paste of some ginger and few cloves of garlic together.

## Cooking

### Cooking the bhindi
* Start heating some oil in a pan. Quantity of oil depends on you but it should be enough to coat all your bhindi with a thin layer. Too much oil makes the Sabji heavy and reduces post enjoyment.
* 3/4th way to smoking point (I have determined smoking point for my set of oil, pan, and stove by doing an experiment beforehand) add the chopped bhindi in the pan.
  * If your pan is small such that much of the bhindi will not directly touch the hot pan:
    - Heat only half of the required oil in your pan and heat the remaining oil in some other pot/pan.
    - 3/4th way to smoking point add bhindi to the pan.
    - Turn over the remaining hot oil on this pan and drizzle it to evenly cover all the bhindi on the pan.
* Using a non-curved and non-intrusive spatula and a light hand, stir the bhindi every 30 seconds on the pan for initial 2 minutes.
* Afterwards, reduce the flame/heat by 25% and stir every 2 minutes.
  * You want to ensure that you are not breaking up your slices of bhindi and the oil is evenly coated on all of them.
* [Troubleshooting] If you see lace coming out of your bhindi, add more oil (can't be too healthy with Bhindi!) and increase the heat slightly.
* Cook for about 15 minutes, reducing the heat towards the end. Ensure that your bhindi is not burning up.
* Cooked bhindi becomes soft, gives off a really nice aroma and turns dark green and shiny.
* Once cooked, switch off the heat and transfer the bhindi to someplace (if you want to re-use your pan) or let it sit in the pan.

### Cooking the masala
* In the empty pan, add some oil. Again quantity depends on how much chopped volume of tomatoes and onion is.
* 1/2 way to smoking point add cumin seeds to the oil.
* Once the first few seeds start sputtering, add following in this order but quickly one after other:
  - Chopped green chilies
  - Ginger-garlic (Chopped or paste)
  - Chopped onion.
* Stir to spread the oil evenly everywhere. Keep the heat constant.
* After the onion has been sauteed (They become translucent and start leaving oil back to the pan), add turmeric, coriander, red chili, and garam masala.
* Stir for about 30 seconds.
* Add chopped tomatoes and increase the heat as much as you can. (Water content and refrigeration of tomatoes reduces the pan contents' temperature dramatically)
* Stir a lot with a heavy hand. Ensure nothing is burning.
* Reduce the heat as you see the temperature is back high in the pan.
* Cook until tomatoes are fried up and have lost at least half of their water to evaporation.

### Final steps
* Add the cooked bhindi to the pan when contents are still hot. Increase the flame a little bit.
* Stir with a light hand and a non-curved and non-intrusive spatula to mix well the masala around the bhindi.
* Lower the heat to simmer point and close the lid.
* Let it sit for about 1 minute.
* Open the lid and let the condensed waterdrop back in.
* Add salt now according to taste.
* Stir lightly for about 1 minute and mix well the salt.

## Eating
* Enjoyed best with whole wheat chapatis (Roti).
* Naan would taste good as well.
* Make some lentils (daal) and enjoy with Basmati rice.
* Added fun with lightly salted and lemon juiced onion, radish or cucumber.
