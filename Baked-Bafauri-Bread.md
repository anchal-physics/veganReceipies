# Baked Bafauri Bread (Moong Bread)

## Ingredients
* Split-Moong daal (1 cup)
* Rice (1/3 cup)
* Urad Daal (1/6 cup)
* Chana Daal (optional, 1/6 cup)
* 1/2 Red onion
* Ginger paste (2 tablespoons)
* Green chilies (optional, can be replaced by other hot peppers)
* Coriander (4 teaspoons)
* Red Chilli powder (According to taste)
* Cumin seeds (2 teaspoon)
* Salt (to taste)
* Baking Powder (1 teaspoon)
* Baking Soda (1/2 teaspoon)
* Vegetable oil (I prefer Soyabean or Sunflower oil)
* Kasuri Methi (Dried fenugreek)

## Optional ingredients (Stir-fried)
* Mustard Seeds (1 teaspoon)
* Curry leaves (5-6)
* Sugar (1 teaspoon)

## Preparation

### Soaking
* Mix all daal and rice together and wash three times. Try not to loose the floating green covers of split moon daal.
* Soak in warm water overnight or atlest 8 hours.

### Batter
* Using a powerful mixer-grinder, make a paste of soaked mixture. Add the ginger piece while grinding or mix paste later.
* The paste should be thick as cake batter and as fine as your mixer allows.
* Chop onion finely and add to the paste.
* Chop according to taste some green chilies and add to the paste.
* Add Coriander, red chilli powder, cumin seeeds and salt.
* You can experiment on adding aromatic spices in small quantities like cinnamon, star anise etc.

## Baking

### Oven pre-heat
* Set oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit or 205 degrees Celsius.
* Line a baking dish with baking sheet and leave the wrinkles as it is. They give nice texture to the edges.
* Right before the oven is about to reach the temperature, add baking powder and soda to your batter and mix well.
* Pour into the baking dish to a maximum height of 1 inch. If you have more batter, prepare another dish. Our bread won't rise too much, so thick layer might leave uncooked batter in the middle.
* Sprinkle small amount salt on the top surface.
* Spray a fine layer of oil over it and sprinkle crushed Kasuri Methi on top.

### Baking
* Put the dish in oven and bake for 20 minutes. Do a toothpick test after 15 min.
* Bake more if inside feels wet. We want a completely dry inside like a bread.
* Take out from oven, let it cool for atleat 10 min and cut into pieces.

### Optional (Stir fry)
* If the bread is too dry for you, you can stir-fry the pieces.
* Heat up some oil tohalfway smoking point in a pan.
* Add mustard seeds and curry leaves to it.
* When seeds start sputtering, add 1/3 cup water.
* Add sugar and mix well.
* Add the bread pieces now and cover them evenly with mustard seeds.
* Close the lid and let it sit for 2 min.
* Open the lid and stir for a while and switch-off stove.

## Eating
* Enjoyed best with green chilli chutney and/or tomato ketchup.
* I also liked it with using Kadhi as a dip (recipe to come soon, meanwhile google).
